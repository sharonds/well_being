## Phase 3.1 Completion Status

Goal (keep it simple): unify scoring and lock essential guardrails (boundaries, config, privacy) without expanding scope beyond what’s needed to safely proceed to Phase 3.2.

### ✅ Completed P0 Blockers
1. **Unified Scoring** ✅
   - Fetcher uses `compute_score` from the engine (single source of truth)

2. **Band Boundary Tests** ✅
   - `dashboard/tests/test_band_boundaries.py` covers 39/40 and 69/70 transitions and edge cases

3. **Privacy Scope Clarification** ✅
   - Privacy scanner in place; telemetry exports contain only metadata; raw JSONL kept local by design

### ✅ Completed P1 Improvements
4. **Central Config Module** ✅
   - `dashboard/config.py` centralizes thresholds with env overrides; backwards compatible

5. **Threshold Promotion** ✅
   - All hardcoded values moved to config (env-overridable)
   - Includes: `INTEGRITY_FAILURE_THRESHOLD_PCT`, `BATTERY_MIN_PERCENT`, `AUTO_RUN_SUCCESS_TARGET_PCT`, `COMPLETENESS_DROP_THRESHOLD_PCT`

6. **Auto-run Normalization** ✅
   - Success rate normalized by distinct calendar days (prevents inflation)

### ✅ Phase 3.2 COMPLETED (2025-08-13)

1. **Integrity Failure Rate** ✅
   ```
   Previous: 28.57% (2/7 records failing)
   Fixed: 0.0% - All records pass integrity check
   Root cause: Scoring formula discrepancy (scores 65/70 → 47/50)
   Solution: Unified scoring engine applied to all records
   ```

2. **Integrity Remediation Loop** ✅
   - Auto-correction for band-only mismatches implemented
   - Automatic quarantine for non-deterministic errors
   - Backup and rollback capability added
   - Dry-run mode for safe testing

## Remaining P1/P2 Items

### P1: Critical for Production ✅ ALL COMPLETE
- [x] **Fix Integrity Failures**: Centralized band mapping in engine and remediated all mismatches
- [x] **Auto-run Metric Verification**: Verified distinct-day normalization with comprehensive test suite
- [x] **Add Remediation Loop**: Auto-correction and quarantine system fully operational

### P2: Operational Excellence
- [ ] **File Locking**: Prevent concurrent write corruption
- [ ] **Retention Policy**: Implement data lifecycle management
- [ ] **CI/CD Integration**: Add privacy and integrity checks to GitHub Actions

## Test Coverage & Validation

### Current Test Suite
```bash
# Unit Tests
dashboard/tests/test_vectors.py          ✅ Score engine validation
dashboard/tests/test_band_boundaries.py  ✅ Critical threshold testing
dashboard/tests/test_integrity.py        ✅ Data integrity checks

# Integration Tests  
dashboard/tests/phase3/test_auto_run.py  ✅ Auto-run tracking
dashboard/scripts/validate_daily_records.py ✅ Schema validation
dashboard/scripts/privacy_scan.py        ✅ Privacy compliance
```

### Production Metrics (After Phase 3.2)
```
Data Completeness: 78.6% (11/14 metrics present)
Auto-run Success: 100% (correctly normalized by distinct days) ✅
Integrity Failures: 0.0% (0/7 records) ✅
Battery Safeguard: Active (15% threshold)
Privacy Violations: 0 (in telemetry exports)
```

## Critical Questions for ChatGPT-5 Review

1. **Integrity Failure Root Cause**: The 28.57% failure rate appears to be a band mapping issue at score=70. Is this a boundary condition bug or expected behavior?

2. **Auto-run Success Definition**: Should success rate be:
   - Records-based (current): Count of successful fetches / total fetches
   - Day-based (proposed): Distinct days with success / total days

3. **Remediation Strategy**: For >1% integrity failures, what automated response is appropriate?
   - Auto-fix band mappings?
   - Quarantine bad records?
   - Alert-only with manual intervention?

4. **Production Readiness**: Given the current state, is the system ready for production with known issues, or should we block until all P1 items are resolved?

## Recommendations & Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Before Production)
1. Fix band mapping at score=70 to resolve integrity failures
2. Implement day-based auto-run success calculation
3. Add automated remediation for integrity failures

### Post-Production Monitoring
1. Daily integrity checks with alerting
2. Weekly completeness trend analysis
3. Monthly retention policy execution

### Long-term Improvements
1. Implement distributed locking for concurrent access
2. Add Prometheus metrics export
3. Create admin UI for threshold tuning

## Success Criteria for Phase 3.2
- [x] Integrity failure rate consistently <1% ✅ (0.0% achieved)
- [x] Auto-run success accurately reflects daily performance ✅ (normalized by distinct days)
- [x] All P1 items resolved with tests ✅ (comprehensive test suite added)
- [ ] Production deployment validated with 30-day burn-in
- [ ] ChatGPT-5 approval of architecture and implementation
