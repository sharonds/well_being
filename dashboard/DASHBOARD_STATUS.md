# Dashboard Status Report

## Current State: Phase 2 COMPLETE ✅

### Infrastructure
- **Grafana**: Running at http://localhost:3001 (admin: wellness_admin / WellBeing2025Test!)
- **InfluxDB**: Running at http://localhost:8087 (token configured)
- **Docker Stack**: Stable with isolated ports (avoiding conflict with port 3000)

### Data Pipeline Status
| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Garmin Connect API | ✅ Working | MFA authentication supported |
| Data Fetch | ✅ Complete | 7 days fetched (Aug 7-13, 2025) |
| Data Integrity | ✅ Validated | 78.6% completeness (missing steps data) |
| InfluxDB Ingestion | ✅ Working | Type conflicts resolved (score as int) |
| Grafana Visualization | ✅ Live | 6 manual queries operational |

### Real Data Summary
- **Date Range**: 2025-08-07 to 2025-08-13
- **Metrics Available**: 
  - Resting Heart Rate: 44-49 bpm (100% available)
  - Sleep Hours: 6.8-9.1 hours (100% available)
  - Stress: Fixed at 50 (100% available)
  - Steps: Only 1 day with data (1012 steps on Aug 13)
- **Scores**: Range 60-70, all in "Maintain" band
- **Completeness**: 78.6% average

### Manual Dashboard Queries (Working)
1. **Wellness Score Over Time**: Line chart showing daily scores
2. **Latest Score Card**: Single stat displaying most recent score
3. **7-Day Average Score**: Gauge showing weekly average
4. **Data Completeness**: Time series of daily completeness percentage
5. **Score Distribution by Band**: Bar chart (fixed with proper string field)
6. **Metrics Presence Heatmap**: Visual grid of metric availability

### Known Issues (Resolved)
- ✅ InfluxDB authentication (401) - Fixed with correct token
- ✅ Dashboard import JSON issues - Pivoted to manual creation
- ✅ MFA authentication - Created interactive scripts
- ✅ Type conflict (score field) - Cast to int before ingestion
- ✅ Bar chart field error - Fixed query to provide string field

## Phase 3 Planning: Operational Reliability

### Next Priorities (from PHASE3_PLANNING.md)
1. **Idempotence & Duplicate Prevention** (AC2)
   - Prevent duplicate scores for same date
   - Add check_duplicate() function

2. **Auto-Refresh KPI Monitoring** (AC1)
   - Track 14-day success rate ≥90%
   - Add telemetry for auto_run flag

3. **Battery-Aware Safe Mode** (AC4)
   - Skip fetch when battery <15%
   - Log SKIP_BATTERY events

4. **Enhanced Drift Detection** (AC5)
   - Hash formula changes
   - Require [FORMULA-INTENT] tag for legitimate changes

5. **Privacy Guard Tests** (AC6)
   - Red-team test to ensure no raw metrics leak
   - Automated privacy validation

### Commands Reference

```bash
# Test Garmin connection (interactive with MFA)
python3 dashboard/scripts/test_garmin_mfa.py

# Fetch new data (interactive, prompts for MFA)
./dashboard/scripts/fetch_with_mfa.sh 7

# Validate data integrity
python3 dashboard/scripts/garmin_integrity.py dashboard/data/garmin_wellness.jsonl

# Ingest to InfluxDB
python3 dashboard/scripts/ingest_influxdb.py dashboard/data/garmin_wellness.jsonl

# View dashboard
open http://localhost:3001
```

### Security & Privacy Status
- ✅ No raw health metrics in telemetry
- ✅ Metrics presence mask (4-bit field)
- ✅ Schema versioning (v2.0.0)
- ✅ .env credentials protected (chmod 600)
- ✅ Default passwords changed
- ✅ Pre-commit guards active

### Deferred Items (Scope Discipline)
- ❌ HRV metrics (device-specific API)
- ❌ VO2 max (not in Phase 1-3 scope)
- ❌ Calorie tracking (explicitly deferred)
- ❌ Long-term trends (>30 days)
- ❌ Multi-user support
- ❌ Cloud sync
- ❌ Predictive/ML layers

## Summary
Phase 2 is complete with real Garmin data successfully flowing through the entire pipeline. The dashboard is operational with manual queries providing insights into wellness scores. Ready to begin Phase 3 focusing on operational reliability and trust without expanding metrics or analytics.
