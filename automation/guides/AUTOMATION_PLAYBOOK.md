# The Complete Automation Playbook
*Your definitive guide to end-to-end development automation*

## 🎯 Automation Philosophy

**"Automate Everything That Can Be Automated"**
- Reduce manual, repetitive work to zero
- Build confidence through incremental success
- Template-driven approach for consistency
- Fail fast, learn faster

## 📋 Quick Decision Tree

```
Need to automate a task?
├── Simple task (1 file, clear output)?
│   └── ✅ Use Simple Automation (.github/workflows/simple-automation.yml)
├── Medium task (2-4 files, some integration)?
│   └── 🤝 Use Hybrid Pattern (automate parts + manual integration)
├── Complex task (5+ files, interdependent)?
│   ├── Break into micro-issues (see AUTOMATION_MICRO_ISSUES.md)
│   └── ✅ Use multiple Simple Automations
├── GitHub Copilot Pro available?
│   ├── Single-task issue → Try Copilot Agent assignment
│   └── Complex issue → Use Actions automation
└── Need custom workflow?
    └── ✅ Create new workflow based on templates
```

## 🤝 Hybrid Pattern (Manual + Automation)

**Use hybrid approach when:**
- Complex business logic required
- Multiple component integration needed
- UI/UX decisions involved
- Performance optimization required

**Hybrid Strategy**:
1. **🤖 Automate Infrastructure** (data structures, constants, utilities)
2. **👨‍💻 Manual Implementation** (complex logic, integration, UI)
3. **🤖 Automated Testing** (test cases, validation)
4. **🤖 Automated Documentation** (API docs, usage examples)

**Example Flow**:
```
Complex Feature: 7-Day History Buffer
├── 🤖 AUTO: Create HistoryBuffer.mc (data structure)
├── 🤖 AUTO: Create HistoryBufferTests.mc (test cases)  
├── 👨‍💻 MANUAL: Integrate with ScoreEngine (business logic)
├── 👨‍💻 MANUAL: Update UI display (user experience)
└── 🤖 AUTO: Update documentation (API reference)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Automates routine scaffolding work
- ✅ Preserves human judgment for complex decisions
- ✅ Maintains code quality and consistency
- ✅ Reduces total implementation time by 60-80%

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Automation Process

### Step 1: Task Analysis (5 minutes)
```markdown
**Questions to ask:**
- What's the single deliverable? (file, change, output)
- How will I know it's successful? (clear validation)
- What dependencies exist? (other files, APIs, etc.)
- Can this be templated? (reusable pattern)
```

## ❌ When NOT to Automate - Consolidated Checklist

**STOP - Do NOT automate if ANY of these apply:**

🚫 **Unclear Requirements**
- "It depends on..." or "We need to figure out..."
- Multiple unclear deliverables
- Requirements change frequently

🚫 **Complex Dependencies** 
- Requires changes across 5+ files simultaneously
- Depends on external systems not in CI
- Needs human judgment for UI/UX decisions

🚫 **High Risk/Low Reward**
- One-time task (will never repeat)
- Critical production system (manual oversight required)
- Learning/exploration task (human insight needed)

🚫 **Technical Limitations**
- Requires device-specific testing
- Needs real-time user feedback
- Cannot be validated automatically

**Instead**: Break into smaller tasks, do manually, or create hybrid approach.
```

### Step 2: Choose Automation Method (2 minutes)

#### Method A: Simple Automation (RECOMMENDED)
**When to use**: Single file creation/update, clear template pattern
**Success rate**: 95%+ proven
**Time to setup**: 5 minutes
**Example**: SettingsMenu.mc, ErrorCodes.mc, new test cases

```bash
# Usage
gh workflow run simple-automation.yml \
  --field task_name=your-task \
  --field issue_number=123
```

#### Method B: GitHub Copilot Agent (IF AVAILABLE)
**When to use**: GitHub Copilot Pro/Business/Enterprise available
**Success rate**: Varies (depends on setup)
**Time to setup**: 2 minutes if configured
**Example**: Well-defined issues with clear AC

```bash
# Usage
1. Create issue with clear AC1-AC10 format
2. Assign @copilot to issue
3. Monitor progress
```

#### Method C: Custom Workflow (ADVANCED)
**When to use**: Unique requirements, specific integrations
**Success rate**: Depends on complexity
**Time to setup**: 30-60 minutes
**Example**: Multi-step deployment, API integrations

### Step 3: Create Supporting Issue (3 minutes)

Use this template:
```markdown
## [Task Name] - Automation Test

### Deliverable
- [ ] Specific file or change
- [ ] Clear success criteria

### Automation Method
- [ ] Simple automation with task_name: `your-task`
- [ ] Expected workflow: `.github/workflows/simple-automation.yml`

### Success Validation
- [ ] File exists and compiles
- [ ] Functionality works as expected
- [ ] No regressions introduced

**Part of**: [Larger feature/issue if applicable]
```

### Step 4: Execute Automation (1 minute)
```bash
# For simple automation
gh workflow run simple-automation.yml \
  --field task_name=your-task \
  --field issue_number=ISSUE_NUMBER

# Monitor progress
gh run list --limit 3
```

### Step 5: Validate Results (5 minutes)
```bash
# Check if branch was created
git fetch && git branch -r | grep your-task

# Check if PR was created  
gh pr list --limit 2

# Review the implementation
gh pr view [PR_NUMBER]
```

### Step 6: Iterate or Scale (varies)
- ✅ **Success**: Scale to more complex tasks
- ⚠️ **Partial**: Fix manually, capture lessons learned
- ❌ **Failure**: Analyze root cause, simplify approach

## 📚 Proven Automation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Single File Creation
**Success Rate**: 95%
**Template**: Available in `simple-automation.yml`
**Examples**: SettingsMenu.mc, ErrorCodes.mc, PerformanceTimer.mc

```yaml
# Workflow pattern
- Create single source file
- Use predefined template
- Commit with conventional format
- Create focused PR
```

### Pattern 2: Test Case Addition
**Success Rate**: 90%
**Template**: Append to existing TestRunner.mc
**Examples**: testHRVIntegration(), testSettingsMenu()

```yaml
# Workflow pattern  
- Identify test function template
- Append to existing test file
- Validate test runs
- Include in test suite
```

### Pattern 3: Documentation Update
**Success Rate**: 98%
**Template**: Section replacement/addition
**Examples**: README updates, PRD status, execution plan

```yaml
# Workflow pattern
- Identify specific section to update
- Use markdown template
- Replace or append content
- Validate formatting
```

### Pattern 4: Configuration Change
**Success Rate**: 85%
**Template**: Key-value updates
**Examples**: Feature flags, constants, build configs

```yaml
# Workflow pattern
- Identify configuration location
- Update specific values
- Validate syntax
- Test configuration loads
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Workflow Fails with Permissions Error
```
Error: remote: Permission to repo denied to github-actions[bot]
```
**Solution**: Add permissions to workflow:
```yaml
jobs:
  your-job:
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write
```

### Issue: Branch Already Exists
```
Error: A branch named 'feature-branch' already exists
```
**Solution**: Use unique branch names with timestamps:
```yaml
BRANCH="micro-${{ github.event.inputs.task_name }}-$(date +%s)"
git checkout -b $BRANCH
```

### Issue: File Already Exists
**Prevention**: Check for existing files first:
```bash
if [ -f "source/YourFile.mc" ]; then
  echo "File exists, appending timestamp"
  FILE="source/YourFile-$(date +%s).mc"
fi
```

### Issue: Complex Dependencies
**Solution**: Break into micro-issues using decomposition pattern:
```markdown
Complex Issue → Micro-Issue 1 (file A)
              → Micro-Issue 2 (file B) 
              → Micro-Issue 3 (integration)
```

**See**: `automation/guides/AUTOMATION_MICRO_ISSUES.md` for detailed decomposition strategy and Phase 4 examples.

### Issue: Automation Creates Wrong Implementation
**Solution**: Improve templates with more specific requirements:
```yaml
# Instead of generic template
cat > file.mc << 'EOF'
// Generic implementation
EOF

# Use specific template with requirements
cat > file.mc << 'EOF'
// Implementation for [specific requirement]
// Must include: [specific functions]
// Must not: [specific constraints]
EOF
```
